The '''Ducati 999''' is a [[Types of motorcycles#Sport bike|sport bike]] made by [[Ducati]] from 2003 to 2006. It superseded the [[Massimo Tamburini]] designed [[Ducati 916]], [[Ducati 996]] and [[Ducati 998]] range of superbikes. This motorcycle enjoyed great success in [[Superbike World Championship|World Superbike]], and was raced in the series through the 2007 season, despite no longer being produced, pending rules changes by the series' governing body, [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]], to allow competition of the new [[Ducati 1098]].

The 999 was designed by [[Pierre Terblanche]], amid much controversy over its styling. It is known as a high performance, race oriented motorcycle. With its traditional [[Ducati]] L Twin Desmodromic Valve actuated engine layout, it has a linear power delivery, with high power and torque figures available even at low RPM. Additionally, with its high spec suspension and trellis chassis, it is one of the finest handling motorcycles for its time.

Subsequently, more powerful 999S and 999R versions were introduced, both capable of 0-62&amp;nbsp;mph (0-100&amp;nbsp;km/h) in under three seconds; and a top speed of over {{convert|170|mph|abbr=on|-1}}.

The 2005 Ducati 999S won the Maxisport category for the prestigious international [[Masterbike|Masterbike 2005]] comparison and finished second overall. It has received critical acclaim from many corners, such as MCN of the U.K. which called it "simply the best V-Twin on the planet", and Motorbikestoday.com, which described it as "the most desirable, most exciting roadbike on the planet" in 2004. MotorcycleUSA.com described it as "stupendous" and "the epitome of V-Twin power." Also known as “the F1 of the motorcycles” in 2005.

==Racing==
From the start the 999 was very successful in the [[Superbike World Championship]], winning world championships in:
* 2003 [[Neil Hodgson]]
* 2004 [[James Toseland]]
* 2006 [[Troy Bayliss]]
[[Gregorio Lavilla]] also won the [[2005_British_Superbike_Championship_season|2005 BSB Title]] on a 999 F04.

For 2017, Harley released the '''Street Rod''' based on the 750 Street model. This new model introduced new features such as higher output Revolution X engine {{convert|68.4|hp|abbr=on}} @ 8,750&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{Convert|47.2|lbft|abbr=on}} @ 4,000&amp;nbsp;rpm, 43 mm inverted front forks and piggyback reservoir rear shocks, drag-style bars and 17 inch wheels.&lt;ref name=rod&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/harley-davidson-street-rod-750-cruiser-first-look-review|last=Hoyer |first=Mark |title=Harley-Davidson Street Rod 750 - FIRST LOOK REVIEW| magazine=[[Cycle World]]|access-date=March 10, 2017|date=March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model, responding to market feedback that demanded a sporty standard, was meant to compete with bikes like the [[Yamaha]] [[Yamaha MT-07|FZ-07]] and [[Yamaha MT-09|FZ-09]].

==Riders Edge Program==
The Street 500 replaced the [[Buell Blast]] in Harley-Davidson's [[Motorcycle safety training|rider training]] program.{{sfn|Fleming|2013}}

==Reactions==
Speculation about Harley "[[outsourcing]]"&lt;!-- quoting original source; do not change this word--&gt; production of 500 and 750&amp;nbsp;cc models (called small-displacement in US press{{sfn|Cathcart|2011}}) to India began at least as early as 2011, along with harsh criticism that by not offering smaller bikes there, Harley "doesn't understand emerging markets".{{sfn|Beeler|2012}}

''The New York Times'' also opined that Harley's move towards medium-displacement echoed that of other manufacturers for the developing world.

The '''Indian FTR''' (formerly '''FTR 1200''') is a [[standard motorcycle]] manufactured by [[Polaris Inc.]] under the [[Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company|Indian Motorcycle marque]] since 2019.&lt;ref name=Hoyer2019/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCN/&gt;

The FTR1200 and its derivative, the FTR1200S, have been noted as having design cues from the sport of flat track racing, including the airbox location, dual exhaust pipes, lightweight appearance, in contradistinction to the usual American [[cruiser motorcycle]], &lt;ref name=Elliott2019/&gt; and "directly target[s] enthusiast riders who currently have traditionally favored the [[Ducati Monster]], [[Triumph Speed Triple]] and [[BMW R nineT]]".&lt;ref name=Carney2019/&gt; The "sport" model FTR1200S has [[electronic stability control]] and [[wheelie]] control, with gyroscopic input to the ABS and other systems to make them lean sensitive.&lt;ref name=Hyatt/&gt;

==FTR750==
The [[Indian Scout FTR750]] [[Track racing#Flat track|flat track racing]] motorcycle is similar in appearance.

The '''Kawasaki Ninja H2''' is a "[[Supercharger|supercharged]] [[Super sport (motorcycle)|supersport]]"-class{{sfn|Shields|2014}} [[motorcycle]] in the [[Kawasaki Ninja|Ninja]] [[Sport bike|sports bike]] series manufactured by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle &amp; Engine|Kawasaki]], featuring a variable-speed [[centrifugal-type supercharger|centrifugal supercharger]].{{sfn|Newland|2014}}{{sfn|Bennetts|2014}}{{sfn|Olgiati|2014}}&lt;ref name="Sport Rider September 24, 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: Supercharged Kawasaki Ninja H2 on Engine Dyno|work=Sport Rider|date=September 24, 2014|url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/video-supercharched-kawasaki-ninja-h2-engine-dyno|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927001504/http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/video-supercharched-kawasaki-ninja-h2-engine-dyno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its namesake is the 750&amp;nbsp;cc [[Kawasaki H2 Mach IV]],{{sfn|Motor Cycle News|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{youTube|bkXRk5JvnrA|Ninja H2: Vol.6 promotional video}} published by Kawasaki, September 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; an [[straight-three engine|inline triple]] that was introduced by Kawasaki in 1972 to "disrupt what it saw as a sleeping motorcycle market".{{sfn|Cameron|2014a}}

Its '''Ninja H2R''' track-only variant is the fastest and most powerful production motorcycle on the market, producing a maximum of {{convert|310|hp}} and {{convert|326|hp}} with [[Ram-air intake|ram-air]].&lt;ref name="firstride" /&gt; The H2R has 50% more power than the fastest [[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]] motorcycles,{{Which|date=August 2022}} while the street-legal Ninja H2 has a lower power output of {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="SR20141005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is this the New 2015 Kawasaki H2 street version teaser video? |url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/new-2015-kawasaki-h2-street-version-teaser-video |work=Sport Rider |date=October 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007231640/http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/new-2015-kawasaki-h2-street-version-teaser-video}}&lt;/ref&gt;–{{convert|210|hp|abbr=on}} with ram-air.&lt;ref name="firstride"/&gt;

== Design ==
Kawasaki selected the [[literbike]] platform for its top-of-the-line Ninja H2 model, rather than continuing with the higher-displacement [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14|Ninja ZX-14]] [[hyperbike]]. ''[[Cycle World]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Kevin Cameron (journalist)|Kevin Cameron]] explained that the literbike class is "the center of the high-performance market", attracting the best development in racing, with the best chassis and suspension design, so it made sense for Kawasaki to create a machine that could leverage this.{{sfn|Cameron|2014a}}

The H2 is the first production motorcycle with a supercharger,{{sfn|Kunitsugu|2014}} although [[turbocharger]]s were available on [[Turbocharger#Motorcycles|some models]] in the early 1980s.

Specifications in the infobox are from Kawasaki unless noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=2015 Ninja H2 specifications |url=http://kawasaki.com/Products/2015-Ninja-H2 |publisher=Kawasaki |access-date=2014-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
The [[street-legal vehicle|street-legal]] Ninja H2 has [[Side-view mirror|mirrors]] in place of the track-only H2R's winglets,&lt;ref name="SR20141005" /&gt; and plastic body panels in place of the H2R's [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers|carbon-fiber]] panels. The street-legal H2 is said to make {{convert|200|hp}}, probably with reduced supercharger boost compared to the H2R.&lt;ref name="SR20141005" /&gt; The H2 and H2R share the supercharger (with a lower boost level on the H2) and many other components, with the exception of the [[head gasket]], cam profile and timing with ECU mapping, exhaust system, and clutch (the H2R's clutch has two additional plates).&lt;ref name="firstride" /&gt;

For 2017, Kawasaki made a limited-edition model with 120 units produced globally: the individually-numbered '''Kawasaki Ninja H2 Carbon''' with special paint and carbon-fiber upper cowl. For 2017, the standard Ninja H2 was also updated.&lt;ref name="carbon"&gt;{{cite web |date=February 2, 2017 |title=Kawasaki Unveils Limited Edition 2017 Ninja H2 Carbon Superbike |url=http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/kawasaki-unveils-limited-edition-2017-ninja-h2-carbon-superbike#page-2// |access-date=February 6, 2017 |publisher=[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2018, Kawasaki made a new [[sport touring]] version of the H2, the '''{{vanchor|Kawasaki H2 SX}}''', with a claimed wet weight of {{convert|564.5|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Features that are options on the base model H2 SX come standard on the '''Kawasaki H2 SX SE''', which has a claimed wet weight of {{convert|573.3|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="touring2018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kunitsugu |first=Kent |date=March 28, 2018 |title=Kawasaki's 2018 H2 SX SE Is The Most Powerful Sport-Tourer You Can Buy |url=https://www.cycleworld.com/kawasakis-2018-h2-sx-se-is-most-powerful-sport-tourer-you-can-buy// |access-date=April 17, 2016 |magazine=[[Cycle World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With revised throttle bodies, camshafts, crankshaft, pistons, cylinder and cylinder head as well as a new exhaust system aimed at increasing mid range torque. The intake system and supercharger impeller were also redesigned.  A new larger fuel tank, rear trellis subframe and panniers increase the bike's weight by {{convert|19|lbs}}.&lt;ref name="touring2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gustafson |first=Joseph |date=November 7, 2017 |title=2018 Kawasaki H2 SX Sport-Tourer Debuts—Get Ready To Wet Your Gore-Tex |url=https://www.cycleworld.com/2018-kawasaki-h2-sx-sport-tourer-debut// |access-date=November 14, 2016 |publisher=[[Cycle World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2019, the H2 received an update with 15% more power from updates to the intake, spark plugs, ECU, and air filter, among other components. Also added was a new LED lighting scheme and a special top coat of paint that is claimed to be self-healing and able to smooth over small scratches in warmer conditions. Also new were lighter and smaller Brembo Stylema calipers, a new TFT dash, and smartphone connectivity that provides information about the GPS route, speed, RPM, current gear, fuel mileage, fuel level, and odometer.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web |date=August 10, 2018 |title=Kawasaki Gives H2 Lineup More Power For 2019 |url=http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/kawasaki-gives-h2-lineup-more-power-for-2019// |access-date=August 14, 2018 |website=Roadracing World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="228HP"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chung |first=Dennis |date=August 10, 2018 |title=2019 Kawasaki Ninja H2 Updated, Now Claims 228HP |url=http://www.motorcycle.com/mini-features/2019-kawasaki-ninja-h2-updated-now-claims-228hp.html// |access-date=August 14, 2018 |website=Motorcycle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 2019 '''Ninja H2 SX SE+''' features electronically controlled suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=6 November 2018 |title=Kawasaki Upgrades 2019 Ninja H2 SX SE+ With Electronic Suspension And More |url=https://www.roadracingworld.com/news/kawasaki-upgrades-2019-ninja-h2-sx-se-with-electronic-suspension-and-more/ |access-date=2019-05-09 |website=www.roadracingworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engine and supercharger ===
The H2's engine is a {{Convert|998|cc|cuin|abbr=unit}} [[Multi-valve|4-valve]], [[DOHC|dual overhead cam]] [[Straight-four engine|inline-4]] with a two-speed [[Centrifugal-type supercharger|centrifugal]] [[supercharger]].{{sfn|Tibu|2014a}}{{sfn|Blain|2014}}{{sfn|Kiser|2014}}{{sfn|Cameron|2014b}}

The supercharger is driven by a series of gears and shafts connecting the flywheel to a [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary drive]], finally spinning a [[Dog clutch|dog-shifted]] two-speed shaft attached to the [[impeller]].{{sfn|Cameron|2014b}} Throttle control is [[Electronic throttle control|electronic]].{{sfn|Cameron|2014c}} A centrifugal supercharger has the advantage of generating less heat than other designs, especially [[scroll-type supercharger|scroll-type]] or [[Screw type supercharger|screw-type]] superchargers.{{sfn|Cameron|2014b}}{{sfn|Kunitsugu|2014}} Without an [[intercooler]] (which the H2 lacks), excess heat in the intake charge can cause [[Engine knocking#Pre-ignition|pre-ignition]] that can damage or destroy the engine.

=== Electronic aids ===
Electronic rider aids include an [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), Kawasaki [[Traction control system|Traction Control]] (KTRC), Kawasaki [[Engine braking|Engine Brake]] Control (KEBC), a Kawasaki [[Quickshifter|Quick Shifter]] (KQS), an electronic [[steering damper]] (ESD), and Kawasaki [[Launch control (automotive)|Launch Control]] Mode (KLCM).{{sfn|Cameron|2014b}}{{sfn|Madson|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shifting-gears.com/kawasaki-ninja-h2-electronic-aids-revealed/|title=Kawasaki Ninja H2: Electronic aids revealed - Shifting-Gears|date=2014-10-20|work=Shifting-Gears|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://speedsociety.com/kawasaki-ninja-h2-launch-control-and-quickshifter/|title=Kawasaki Ninja H2 Launch Control And Quickshifter|work=Speed Society|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aerodynamics ===
{{Update|part=section|date=August 2022|reason=The description of the H2R's aero is hypothetical}}
The front fairing of the Ninja H2R incorporates winglets{{sfn|Stock|2014}} made of [[carbon fiber]], just like the rest of the H2R-exclusive bodywork. They may be [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamic devices]] designed to create a low-pressure zone to help move [[air cooling|cooling air]] through the engine bay,{{sfn|Lavrinc|2014}} to produce [[downforce]] at high speed,{{sfn|Kiser|2014}}{{sfn|Blain|2014}} or to provide [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Stability|straight-line stability]] in a short-[[wheelbase]] sportsbike chassis.{{sfn|Kunitsugu|2014}}{{sfn|Beeler|2014}}

=== Chassis ===
The H2 and H2R have a tubular, thin-wall steel [[trellis frame]] and a [[single-sided swingarm]],{{sfn|Kunitsugu|2014}} with a traditional sportsbike wheelbase of {{Convert|1450|mm|in|abbr=unit}}.{{sfn|Abrahams|2014}}

Explaining the advantages of Kawasaki's approach to exploiting aerodynamics instead of lengthening the wheelbase, a South African writer{{Who|date=August 2022}} said, "It's easy to build stability into a hard-accelerating drag machine with a long wheelbase... but Kawasaki wanted a track-day machine, one that would also go round corners."{{sfn|Abrahams|2014}} High speed motorcycles often have long wheelbases. Extra length is added by the extended swingarm on a typical [[Motorcycle drag racing|drag motorcycle]], and a typical [[motorcycle land-speed record|land speed record]] [[streamliner]] has a meters-long wheelbase (3.7 meters for the current record holder, [[Ack Attack]]).

== Pre-Intermot engine announcements and analysis ==
The H2 was announced by Kawasaki in a late-2014 [[teaser campaign]], and was widely expected to be fully revealed at the [[Intermot]] motorcycle trade show the same year. Before full details were released by Kawasaki, the supercharged inline-4 engine&lt;ref name="Sport Rider September 24, 2014"/&gt; was thought by several industry observers to be identical to, or closely related to, a nearly 1,000&amp;nbsp;cc inline-4 with a centrifugal supercharger displayed by Kawasaki at the 2013 [[Tokyo Motor Show]].{{sfn|Bennetts|2014}}{{efn|Cameron also recalled Kawasaki's supercharged piston engine experience with the WWII era [[Kawasaki Ha40]] aircraft engine.{{sfn|Cameron|2014a}}}}{{sfn|Visordown|2014}}

Cameron published an analysis showing that an engine of that displacement, mildly boosted at {{convert|5|psi|abbr=on}}, would generate {{convert|203|hp}}—more than that of Kawasaki's current leader, the {{convert|191.7|hp|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="roadtest"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lenatsch |first=Nick |date=March 7, 2012 |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2012/03/07/kawasaki-zx-14r-road-test// |title=Kawasaki ZX-14R – Road Test |work=[[Cycle World]] |access-date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14|ZX-14]] (horsepower figures are expressed at the rear wheel). The same engine would generate {{convert|257|hp}} with {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}} of pressure. His analysis included a discussion of the benefits of a [[Supercharger#Two-speed and two-stage superchargers|two-speed supercharger]] for more linear power delivery (as opposed to the intractable [[Forced induction in motorcycles#Forced induction in production motorcycles|Japanese turbo bikes of the 1980s]] that suffered from [[turbo lag]]). Cameron also said Kawasaki patent documents suggested the engine would rely on [[Evaporative cooler|evaporative cooling]] using port fuel injection, instead of a bulky [[intercooler]].{{sfn|Cameron|2014a}}

Kawasaki claimed the 2013 model had the first supercharger designed by a motorcycle manufacturer.{{sfn|Ets-Hokin|2013}} In 2013, journalists said that the engine could power the "next generation [Ninja] ZX-14R" sportbike.{{sfn|Siler|2013}} Journalists also noted that Kawasaki already has a production inline-4 supercharged (albeit intercooled&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2012 Jet Ski Ultra 300X detail &amp; features |publisher=Kawasaki |date=c. 2014 |url=http://www.kawasaki.com/products/product-details-features.aspx?id=560&amp;scid=0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140915184613/http://www.kawasaki.com/products/product-details-features.aspx?id=560&amp;scid=0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) engine powering the [[Jet Ski]] Ultra 300X [[personal watercraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaser video announces 2015 Kawasaki Ninja H2|date=September 1, 2014|work=Sport Rider |url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/kawasaki-announces-2015-ninja-h2-teaser-video|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904192928/http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/kawasaki-announces-2015-ninja-h2-teaser-video|archive-date=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Production announcement ==

At the 2014 Intermot motorcycle trade show on September 30, 2014, Kawasaki announced that a race-only Ninja H2R model would be produced in addition to the detuned street-legal Ninja H2, which would be fully revealed at the [[EICMA]] trade show in November.{{sfn|Kiser|2014}}{{sfn|Motor Cycle News|2014}} The bike was shown for the first time in North America at the AIMExpo show at Orlando, Florida in October, 2014.{{sfn|Bornhop|2014}}

According to details Kawasaki made public about the H2's engine at Intermot, it was confirmed to be a 998&amp;nbsp;cc [[inline-four engine]] with a supercharger, producing {{convert|300|hp}} in the track-only H2R variant, still by far the highest rated engine ever for any factory production motorcycle{{sfn|Kiser|2014}}{{sfn|Tibu|2014a}}{{sfn|Blain|2014}} (50% more than its nearest competitor, the [[BMW S1000RR]]).{{sfn|Motor Cycle News|2014}}

=== Reception ===
Global press coverage both before and after Intermot was extensive.

Before the full reveal of the H2R, reactions tended to emphasize the reintroduction of [[Forced induction in motorcycles|forced induction to the motorcycle marketplace]], with headlines like "Hail the New Supercharged Era" ([[Autoevolution]]),{{sfn|Tibu|2014a}} "Supercharged Ninja imminent" (''[[Motor Cycle News]]''),{{sfn|Newland|2014}} "New Kawasaki sports bike will use a 1000cc supercharged engine" (Visordown (UK)),{{ref|Visordown|2014}} "Kawasaki officially uncovers Ninja H2 supercharger" (''Cycle Online'' (Australia)),{{sfn|Shields|2014}} "Kawasaki Ninja H2: How the supercharger works" (''[[:it:Motociclismo (rivista)|Motociclismo]]''),{{sfn|Olgiati|2014}} and "Kawasaki's H2 superbike: A technical look at Kawasaki’s upcoming supercharged superbike" (''Cycle World'').{{sfn|Cameron|2014a}}

After the introduction, before any test rides had even been permitted, coverage turned to both the bike's unusual styling and its precedent setting power. Both industry and general-readership press said the machine "will beat up the supersport scene with a [[steam hammer]]" (''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]''),{{sfn|Walter|2014}} "smashes the superbike class" (Gizmag),{{sfn|Blain|2014}} is "a game changer" (Autoevolution),{{sfn|Tibu|2014b}} "a quantum leap into the future that redefines the way we see motorcycles" (Independent Newspapers),{{sfn|Abrahams|2014}} and "the poster child of 2-wheeled insanity&amp;nbsp;... so extreme it's hard to comprehend" (''[[Road &amp; Track]]''),{{sfn|Kierstein|2014}} or was simply "radical" (''Motor Cycle News''){{sfn|Motor Cycle News|2014}} and even "ludicrous" (''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'').{{sfn|Stock|2014}}

''Cycle World'' and ''Motor Cycle News'' both commented on how Kawasaki had claimed the high end of the market with the H2, moving past a stagnant market (at least from the [[Japanese Big Four]] manufacturers) full of cookie-cutter sportsbikes and low-priced entry-level bikes, and had set up the H2 as a [[halo model]] for the entire brand. Cameron said, "When we look at the current crop of 1000s, all date from before our present "recession," and what little has come by way of new product has sought to please the mostly imaginary "new buyer" with low-tech delights."{{sfn|Cameron|2014b}} Highlighting Kawasaki's ability to create a product leveraging aerodynamic, turbine and engine technology design expertise from across the large [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] conglomerate (called a "vast industrial complex" by ''Sport Rider''{{sfn|Kunitsugu|2014}}), an unsigned ''Motor Cycle News'' piece said "The H2R you see here is the very pinnacle of what Kawasaki can do&amp;nbsp;... This is the firm's halo product, and every element is Kawasaki at its very best, from the engine and aerodynamic development, through to the mirror-finish black chrome paint specially developed for this model."{{sfn|Motor Cycle News|2014}}

Some analysts noted odd features of the supposedly track-only H2R model. Although it is outfitted with [[racing slicks]] and lacks many features required on a [[street-legal vehicle]] in most jurisdictions, such as headlights, rear view mirrors, and turn signals visible from the front or sides, it also has features that are unusual or absent on pure track bikes, such as an ignition lock and LED tail light.{{sfn|Motor Cycle News|2014}}{{sfn|Beeler|2014}}{{clear}}

'''MZ 1000S''' is a 998&amp;nbsp;cc 180-degree [[straight-twin engine|parallel twin]] [[motorcycle]] produced between 2004 and 2007 released in the USA in 2005&lt;ref name=MCN/&gt; by the now defunct German company [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ Motorrad]]. Once the flagship of the range, the 1000S was MZ's largest-ever displacement motorcycle, and their first multi-cylinder bike since 1959. The MZ 1000S was the most powerful production inline twin cylinder engine worldwide.&lt;ref name=topspeed/&gt;

== Company history ==
In the Communist era, the East German firm MZ Motorrad produced only single-cylinder, small-displacement motorcycles. These were mostly rugged 2-stroke commuters, from which MZ developed successful 250&amp;nbsp;cc [[ISDT]] machines. MZ were then world leaders in 2-stroke design, but chief engineer and rider [[Ernst Degner]] defected to the West, selling MZ technical know-how to [[Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt; Degner's defection [http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-japanese-motorcycles/suzuki-ernst-degner-ze0z1202zsch]&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, MZ had access to Western designers and  resources, and they hoped to move into a more sophisticated market. In 1994 the factory produced the [[MZ Skorpion|Skorpion]] range. Conceived by British design firm Seymour Powell, it used a 660&amp;nbsp;cc Yamaha single-cylinder engine. The Skorpion was followed in 2001 by the Baghira [[motard]], which also used the Yamaha engine.&lt;ref name=MCN/&gt; Later, after being taken over by [[Hong Leong Group]] of Malaysia, MZ began a project to produce its own 1000cc superbike, but MZ stopped all production in 2013.

== Development history ==
The 1000S "New Edge" design was drawn by Peter Naumann who designed the [[F-117 Stealth Fighter]], and the 1000S won a silver medal from International Design Forum.&lt;ref name=motorcyclist/&gt;&lt;ref name=motorcycleusa/&gt; Initial reports were that this would have a V-twin engine, but MZ eventually opted for a parallel-twin instead with a 180° crank.&lt;ref&gt; Motorcycle News October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The frame is a twin-spar design, not unlike that of the [[Aprilia SL1000 Falco|Aprilia Falco]]; but whereas the Falco has an alloy frame, the MZ used chrome-moly steel. The prototype model of the 1000S was previewed during [[Intermot]] 2000 in Germany and went into production in 2003. The bike initially sold well, particularly in Germany.  MZ, who had grand plans to become a major world manufacturer, went on to produce some variants of the 1000S such as the MZ 1000SF naked bike and MZ 1000ST sports touring bike. Financial troubles set in and the MZ factory was closed.

==Model range==

===MZ 1000S===
Although the '''S''' model is a [[sport bike]] with [[clip-ons]] and rear-set footrests, the bike is nevertheless comfortable and capable of touring with a pillion passenger. Its engine is a [[Radiator|liquid-cooled]] 999&amp;nbsp;cc [[DOHC]] 8-valve [[4-stroke]] 40° inclined parallel twin with a 180° crankshaft, and a balance shaft.{{Vague|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;MZ 1000S Spares Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; It has electronic [[fuel injection]], and [[Wet sump|wet-sump]] lubrication. It has [[Nissin Kogyo|Nissin]] brakes, [[Marzocchi]] male-slider forks, and an alloy [[cantilever]] [[swinging arm|swingarm]] rear suspension. Although the engine is compact, the bike is fairly heavy at 208&amp;nbsp;kg (dry).

===MZ 1000ST===
The '''ST''' is a milder [[sport touring|sports-tourer]] motorcycle based on the "S". The engine is detuned for more torque but still produces {{convert|83|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. Compared to the "S", the ST is modified for touring comfort, with higher handlebars and lower footrests to provide a roomier seating position for long distance riding. The screen is 30&amp;nbsp;mm higher for better wind protection. A plusher rear seat provides more comfort for the pillion. The ST's engine has altered clutch springs to reduce the effort required to operate the clutch. {{ill|Krauser GmbH|de|Krauser (Unternehmen)|lt=Krauser}} hard luggage may be fitted, and a steering damper keeps the bike stable when fully loaded.

[[File:MZ 1000 S und SF.jpg|thumb|S &amp; SF bikes together]]

=== MZ 1000SF ===
The '''SF''' "SuperFighter" is a naked [[streetfighter]], using the same engine as the ST.&lt;ref name=visordown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visordown.com/reviews/motorcycles/naked/mz-1000sf//|title=MZ 1000SF review | publisher=Visor Down|accessdate=January 27, 2017|date=January 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The MZ 1000 was quite well received, although [[Motorcycle News|MCN]] journalists thought it rather expensive and "poor value". MCN damned the bike with faint praise, saying: "But as the [[Yamaha TRX850]] demonstrated, many bikers aren't especially keen on parallel twins..." and "MZ is trying something different with its parallel twin 1000S and Streetfighter, but it lacks the X factor and doesn't have the kind of dealer/distributor back-up you need when buying a slightly oddball motorbike."&lt;ref name=MCN/&gt;

However, in a four-bike comparison test in 2005 between the [[Honda VTR1000F|Honda Firestorm]], [[Ducati SuperSport|Ducati 1000SS]], [[Suzuki SV1000]], ''Fast Bikes'' magazine declared the MZ 1000S the clear winner, saying: "It combines the uniqueness and style of the Italian, with the usability and build quality of the Japanese, and to top it all off is far more fun to ride than any of them."&lt;ref&gt;''Fast Bikes'' January 2005 page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]] praised the bike saying: "The MZ 1000 is a well-engineered, capable machine that is built to last..."

The '''Triumph Thunderbird''' is [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph]] [[motorcycle]] made in [[Hinckley]], England, and sold since June 2009.&lt;ref name=torygraph&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorbikes/5357085/Triumph-Thunderbird-review.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090524200708/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorbikes/5357085/Triumph-Thunderbird-review.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= 24 May 2009 | title= Triumph Thunderbird review | last= Ash | first= Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Ash | newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date= 22 May 2009 | accessdate= 23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The name "Thunderbird" is revived from a previous Triumph three-cylinder 885&amp;nbsp;cc bike. The name was previously applied to a single carburettor version of the 650cc twin Bonneville produced in the mid-1960s for police work. The final iteration was the Thunderbird Sport, last made in 2004.

==Design==
[[File:2011Sept 021.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Triumph Thunderbird Storm]]
The Thunderbird is a [[Cruiser (motorcycle)|cruiser]] with a large 200/50 R17 rear tyre.  [[Motorcycle design|Design]] was by [[Tim Prentice (designer)|Tim Prentice]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name=torygraph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2-wheel lowdown|last=Winfield|first=Barry|journal=[[Autoweek]]|page=40|volume=59|number=20|date=October 2009|id={{ProQuest|218931195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DOHC]] eight-valve [[Straight-twin engine|parallel-twin engine]] has two [[balance shaft]]s and a [[Straight-twin engine#270°|270° crank]], which imitates the sound and feel of a [[V-twin engine|V-twin]].  The {{convert|1597|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} engine was originally intended to be [[modular design|modular]], namely "two-thirds of" a [[Triumph Rocket III]] engine; but after four years of development, the only parts in common are the valves.  Power output is {{convert|85|bhp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and torque is {{convert|108|lb.ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=torygraph/&gt; 
The engine has two spark plugs per cylinder, which gives better combustion, resulting in lower fuel consumption, cleaner exhaust emissions, and more power. Brakes are double front discs with four-piston callipers, with a single rear disc also with two-piston callipers (ABS as option).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twowheelsblog.com/post/477/2009-triumph-thunderbird-1600|title=Thunderbird 1600|accessdate=4 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814212847/http://www.twowheelsblog.com/post/477/2009-triumph-thunderbird-1600|archivedate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final drive is via a [[Gilmer belt|belt drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterandfaster.net/2008/07/first-pics-2009-triumph-thunderbird.html|title=First pics: 2009 Triumph Thunderbird 1600|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Thunderbird Storm variant model was released featuring the previously-optional {{convert|1699|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} engine fitted as standard, twin headlamps and with a number of black, rather than chrome parts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/triumph/2011-triumph-thunderbird-storm-review-90408.html | first= Troy | last= Siahaan| date= 8 February 2011 | publisher= Motorcycle.com | title= 2011 Triumph Thunderbird Storm Review | accessdate= 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

A road test of the Thunderbird by ''[[Motorcycle News]]'' in May 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/First-rides--tests/2009/May/may1409-triumph-thunderbird-first-ride/ | publisher= [[Motorcycle News]] | title=  First ride: Triumph Thunderbird | date= 14 May 2009 | accessdate= 23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
found that the motorcycle performed well, and handling and braking were significantly superior to comparable American or Japanese cruiser models.
In 2009 and 2010, US motorcycle magazine ''[[Cycle World]]'' awarded the Thunderbird "Best Cruiser" in its annual "Ten Best Bikes" feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title= 2010 Ten Best Bikes Best Cruiser: Triumph Thunderbird 1600 | url= http://www.cycleworld.com/motorcycle_roadtest/ten_best_bikes_2010/best_cruiser_triumph_thunderbird_1600 | magazine= Cycle World |date=July 2010 | issn= 0011-4286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yamaha WR250F''' is an [[types of motorcycles#Off-road|off-road]] motorcycle made by [[Yamaha Motor Company]]. It has a {{Convert|250|cc|abbr=on}} [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid-cooled]] [[single-cylinder|single]] [[nikasil]] coated [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] engine.  First offered in 2001, it shared many components and design concepts with the [[Yamaha YZ250F|YZ250F]] motocross model. It is basically the YZ250F detuned slightly for more controllable power, with a headlight and lighting coil, softer suspension, a [[kickstand]], better noise specifications, larger radiators, and lower emissions. The WR250F is basically a YZ250F modified for enduro competitions, extreme enduro competitions and hard enduro competitions and the practice of these extreme sports. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/photos/2008models/2008models-Yamaha-WR250F.htm Total motorcycle.com 2008 Yamaha WR250F&lt;/ref&gt;  The WR in the name indicates a [[Gear ratio#Wide-ratio vs. close-ratio transmission|wide-ratio gear box]] common to most [[Enduro motorcycle|enduro]] or trail bikes and stands in contrast to the close-ratio gearbox essential to a [[motocross]] racer. Over the years the WR250F has benefited from the advances made in the YZ motocross version gaining advancements such as an aluminum frame and improved suspension.

Despite the similar name, it shares very few common components with the heavier, street-legal dual sport dirt oriented [[Yamaha WR250R|WR250R]]  or its sister supermoto build WR250X.

The '''Honda CBX550F''' is a [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]], [[Multi-cylinder engine#Four-cylinder engines|in line four cylinder]], [[Types of motorcycles#Sport touring|sport tourer]] motorcycle produced from 1982 to 1986 by the [[Honda|Honda Motor Company]].&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoemark|first=Pete|title=Honda CBX550 572.5cc 1982 to 1986: Owners Workshop Manual|date=1989|publisher=Haynes|ISBN=0856969400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBX550F II is identical apart from the addition of a [[Motorcycle fairing#Half fairing|half-fairing]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoemark|first=Pete|title=Honda CBX550 572.5cc 1982 to 1986: Owners Workshop Manual|date=1989|publisher=Haynes|page=6|ISBN=0856969400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the model was designated ''550'', the actual capacity was {{convert|572.5|cc|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Haynes"/&gt; Honda developed a completely new, unusual design of engine to compete in the middleweight-sector with twin [[overhead camshaft]]s acting on [[Rocker arm|rockers]], having screw-adjusters for [[Four-stroke engine#Valve clearance|clearance]] which actuated the sixteen valves ([[Multi-valve|four per cylinder]]).

The engine featured a standard [[Oil cooling|oil-cooler]] and a distinctive, unusual exhaust system, a first for Honda, with cross-over pipes directly in front of the engine linking cylinders one to four and a separate pair of pipes connecting cylinders two and three. The CV carburettors were of a new type using [[Carburetor#Choke|mixture-enriching]] internal fuel passages for cold-starts, with careful engineering of the inlet tracts to achieve smooth gasflow.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Motor Cycle News]]'' (UK weekly newspaper) 5 May 1982, p.21 ''Honda CBX550.This gem sets new standards'', Terry Snelling. Accessed and added 2015-11-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine was noted for its use of inboard ventilated [[disc brakes]], the discs themselves being contained within a "drum" type enclosure.&lt;ref name ="ReferenceA"/&gt; Front suspension was by oil-damped [[Motorcycle fork#telescopic|telescopic fork]] with air assistance and incorporating an anti-dive mechanism in the left fork leg.&lt;ref name ="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rear suspension was by Honda's own "Pro-Link" rising rate system, which allows the suspension forces to vary in accordance with rear wheel movement.&lt;ref name ="ReferenceA"/&gt; The machine was equipped with transistorised ignition and electrics were 12 volt.
